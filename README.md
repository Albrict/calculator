# calculator
My first simple calculator in C.

# Usage
<sub>
Just type some numbers like that:

1
+
1
2


Or you can add equals symbol at the end:

1
+
1
=
2

Also you can type more than one operator:

1
+
1
*
2
=
4

As you can see, this calculator dosn't support calculation order. Maybe add this function in future.
