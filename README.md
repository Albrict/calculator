# calculator
Simple calculator in C.

# Usage

Just type some numbers like this:
<br />
1
<br />
+
<br />
1
<br />
2
<br />
Or you can add equal sym at the end:
<br />
1
<br />
+
<br />
1
<br />
$=$
<br />
2
<br />
You can have many operators, but this calculator dosn't support calculation logic. Maybe add this function in future.
