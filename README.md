# calculator
My first simple calculator in C.
# Installiton 
```
git clone https://github.com/Albrict/calculator
cd calculator
make install
```

# Usage

Just type some numbers like this:
<br />
1
<br />
+
<br />
1
<br />
2
<br />
Or you can add equal sym at the end:
<br />
1
<br />
+
<br />
1
<br />
$=$
<br />
2
<br />
You can have many operators, but this calculator dosn't support calculation logic. Maybe add this function in future.
